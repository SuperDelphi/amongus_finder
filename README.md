# amongus_finder
A Python algorithm that counts the amount of amongus/amongi characters found in a 1:1 pixel-art image.

**NOTE: This code is at very, very early stage. It works, but please spare your eyes and don't take a look at the code (maybe it should be closed-source for that particular reason).**
